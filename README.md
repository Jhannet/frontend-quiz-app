- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- [JQuery](https://releases.jquery.com/)

### What I learned

I learned to create a html structure for a page from scratch, considering tags like header, aside and to create div containers for main sections.
I used CSS grid layout to align positions of main elements of the page structure and with @media I defined styles for different device sizes.
I added a font style for all the pages with local font style files.
To design icons I used css properties to set special borders and background colors, I used flexbox to align the content.
```css
.option-icon {
    height: 40px;
    width: 40px;
    background-color: #F4F6FA;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.option-icon strong {
    color: inherit;
    text-align: center;
}
```
With Javascript and JQuery I loaded data dynamically and set them on the pages in a determined moment, implementing all the required functionality.
To pass data from a page to another I did it using url params.
For animations I used css properties like :hover, :active, :focus and :checked and with JQuery adding and removing elements and css classes.
With JQuery I implemented event listeners, to set functionality for some elements.
```js
$(`#option-${selectedOption}`).addClass("wrong-answer");
$(`#option-${selectedOption} .option-icon`).addClass("error-color");
$(`#option-${selectedOption} .menu-item-container`).append(`<div class="error-icon"><strong>x</strong></div>`);
```
I learned about accessibility and implemented it with tabindex attributes in 'a' tags.
I learned to write code for many of the same css classes just in one statement block.

### Continued development

I need to learn or improve:
- Best practices to structure pages from scratch
- How to use global variables in css to have better manipulation when changing a thing in different parts like colors, sizes
- Improve to pass data from a page to another
- When create a new html page
- Create clean components to reuse them
